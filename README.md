## Association Rule Mining  
Recommendations are made on aisle level as having 39K unique products made it difficult to visually represent. 20k rules are generated with aisle level which is again difficult to represent visually. To overcome this rules are categorized into 3 categories based on lift. Lift here is ranging from 0 to 5.25.  
### Low Impact  
These product combinations have lift less than 1 which means they should not be recommended together.

### Medium Impact

### Cluster-1  
These cluster customer visit instacart often but they don't bring great revenue as they have less orders and products. 
### Cluster-2
